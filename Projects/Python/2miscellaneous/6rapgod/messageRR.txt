I just downvoted your comment.

# FAQ

## What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

## Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

- ⁠Rudeness towards other Redditors, - ⁠Spreading incorrect information, - ⁠Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

## Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare situations
