-The script takes information from, first provinces that have connection to the sea, then land provinces, then every province where movement is possible. So, editing
the locator of a province with access to the sea in the fort locators or combat locators files won't affect it in the slightest.
-The script will try to find the province if the locator given wrongly points to the sea or another province, but islands are much more difficult to track, so those might
 have to be fixed manually.
