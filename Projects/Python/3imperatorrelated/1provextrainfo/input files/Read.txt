Place in this folder:
- definition.csv from /map_data, transformed into a xlsx (important), careful with using weird characters such as Ä‘
- provinces.png from /map_data. Set anything you DONT want to change names with color black RGB = (0,0,0)

The program will output a file named provincenames_l_english.yml

After it finishes, open the output file, select all (Ctrl+A) and copy. Go to your /localization/english/provincenames_l_english.yml, open it, select all and paste.
