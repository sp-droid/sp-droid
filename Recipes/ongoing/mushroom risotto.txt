A single strand of saffron
Quality olive oil
400g mushrooms
Bunch of parsley
1 small onion
300g rice, Carnaroli, Arborio (starchy for creaminess but also keeps shape)
1/2 glass of white wine
600ml vegetable stock
Butter
Parmigiano Reggiano

Leave a glass of water with the saffron for 24h

Now stir frequently at every step of the way
Cut mushrooms in thin slices and reduce them on a low heat with some oil and a touch of salt
When it's reduced, add half of the finely chopped parsley and keep cooking until golden

Separately, cook the finely chopped onion on a medium-low heat with some oil until golden
Add rice, toast for 3-4 minutes
Pour the wine and start counting (check the cooking time for the rice), wait until it evaporates
Add the saffron water
To avoid letting it dry, add stock progressively. If it runs out switch to water.
4 minutes before the time add half of the mushrooms.
After the required time, check the rice texture. If it's ready turn off the heat.
Stir in the butter and finely grated cheese.
Check for salt.

For plating, sprinkle the remaining parsley and mushrooms
